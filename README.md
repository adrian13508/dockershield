**Catch exposed ports before hackers do**

## The Problem

Ever wondered if your database is accidentally exposed to the internet? You're not alone.

**Docker bypasses UFW firewall rules by default.** That means your `ufw deny 5432` won't protect your PostgreSQL container. Most developers don't realize this until it's too late.

I learned this the hard way when I got an alert from my VPS provider: *"Suspicious activity detected on port 5432."* My production database had been exposed to the internet for 3 months despite having UFW configured. Docker had bypassed it entirely by directly manipulating iptables.

**Real-world data from security scans:**
- 86% of self-hosted VPS instances have at least one critical port exposed to 0.0.0.0
- Most common exposures: PostgreSQL (5432), Redis (6379), MongoDB (27017)
- Average time to discovery: 3+ months

DockerShield exists so you don't make the same mistake.

## ⚡ 60-Second Quickstart

```bash
# Install and run your first scan
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adrian13508/dockershield/main/install.sh | bash
dockershield scan
```

**Example output:**
```
🔴 CRITICAL: PostgreSQL exposed to 0.0.0.0:5432
🔴 CRITICAL: Redis exposed to 0.0.0.0:6379
🟡 MEDIUM: Grafana exposed to 0.0.0.0:3000

Security Score: 45/100 (FAIR)

Fix: docker run -p 127.0.0.1:5432:5432 postgres
```

**That's it.** Full security report in your terminal.

## ✨ Features

### Docker Security
- **Container Scanning**: Lists all Docker containers with their port bindings
- **Intelligent Port Analysis**: Recognizes 50+ dangerous ports (databases, admin panels, etc.)
- **Network Topology**: Maps Docker networks and container relationships
- **Firewall Monitoring**: Detects when Docker bypasses UFW/iptables

### System Security
- **SSH Configuration Audit**: Analyzes SSH security (root login, password auth, key-only setup)
- **fail2ban Intrusion Prevention**: Checks if fail2ban is installed, running, and protecting critical services
- **System Update Status**: Tracks pending updates, security patches, and reboot requirements

### Reporting & Automation
- **Security Scoring**: 0-100 score with EXCELLENT/GOOD/FAIR/POOR/CRITICAL ratings
- **Risk Classification**: Automatically categorizes issues as CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Get exact commands to fix security issues
- **JSON Output**: Machine-readable format for CI/CD and automation
- **Prometheus Metrics**: `scan --prometheus` emits node_exporter textfile format for Grafana dashboards and alerting
- **CI-Friendly Exit Codes**: `scan --fail-on critical` exits with code 2 when critical findings exist — gate deploys or trigger alerts from any script
- **Color-Coded Output**: Red for critical, yellow for medium, green for safe

### Distribution & Updates
- **Auto-Update**: Built-in upgrade command with release notifications
- **One-Line Installer**: Simple curl command to install
- **Cross-Platform**: Supports Linux (amd64, arm64, arm), macOS (Intel, M1/M2), Windows
- **Zero Configuration**: Works immediately out of the box

### Dangerous Ports Detected

DockerShield identifies risky exposures including:
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL (5432), MySQL (3306), MongoDB (27017), Redis (6379), Elasticsearch (9200)
- **Admin Interfaces**: Grafana (3000), Prometheus (9090), Portainer (9000), Docker daemon (2375/2376)
- **Remote Access**: SSH (22), RDP (3389), VNC (5900)
- **Message Queues**: RabbitMQ (5672), Kafka (9092)
- Plus 40+ other services

## 📈 Continuous Monitoring (Prometheus)

DockerShield is strictly read-only — it never changes your system. For continuous
monitoring, run it from cron and publish metrics through the node_exporter
[textfile collector](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter#textfile-collector):

```bash
# /etc/cron.d/dockershield — scan every 15 minutes
*/15 * * * * root dockershield scan --prometheus > /var/lib/node_exporter/textfile/dockershield.prom.$$ && mv /var/lib/node_exporter/textfile/dockershield.prom.$$ /var/lib/node_exporter/textfile/dockershield.prom
```

Exported metrics: `dockershield_security_score`, `dockershield_risks{severity}`,
`dockershield_exposed_port{container,port,protocol,severity}`,
`dockershield_docker_bypassing_ufw`, `dockershield_ufw_active`,
`dockershield_containers{state}`, `dockershield_last_scan_timestamp_seconds`.

Example Prometheus alert rules:

```yaml
groups:
  - name: dockershield
    rules:
      - alert: DockerBypassingUFW
        expr: dockershield_docker_bypassing_ufw == 1
        for: 5m
        annotations:
          summary: "Docker is bypassing UFW on {{ $labels.instance }}"
      - alert: CriticalPortExposed
        expr: dockershield_exposed_port{severity="critical"} == 1
        for: 5m
        annotations:
          summary: "{{ $labels.container }} exposes port {{ $labels.port }} publicly on {{ $labels.instance }}"
      - alert: DockershieldScanStale
        expr: time() - dockershield_last_scan_timestamp_seconds > 3600
        annotations:
          summary: "DockerShield scan has not run for over an hour on {{ $labels.instance }}"
```

No Prometheus? The `--fail-on` flag turns any cron job into an alert:

```bash
dockershield scan --fail-on critical > /dev/null || curl -s -d "DockerShield: critical exposure on $(hostname)" ntfy.sh/your-topic
```

## 🎯 Goals

DockerShield helps you answer critical security questions like:
- Are any of my database ports exposed to the internet?
- Is Docker bypassing my firewall (UFW/iptables)?
- Is my SSH configuration secure (key-only auth, no root login)?
- Is fail2ban protecting my server from brute-force attacks?
- Are there critical security updates I need to install?
- Which containers are on which networks?

Perfect for indie developers running 1-10 VPS instances who need comprehensive security visibility without enterprise-grade complexity or cost.
